# Simple-Linear-Regression
This is a linear regression model done on a data where I tuned the independent variable values to find the best model with minimum prediction error.

I have taken three values for the independent variable X.
Values of X being: X,X squared, Log(X)
I build 3 Linear Regression Model using these 3 values of X and found out the mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error for these three models
and plotted them in a bar graph to find the best fit model.
